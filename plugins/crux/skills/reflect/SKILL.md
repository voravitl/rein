name: reflect
description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

Read [Runtime guide](../../references/runtime.md) before executing this skill. It defines native tools, role/model resolution, history scope, and unsupported integrations.


# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Locate the current Codex transcript using the runtime adapter. Verify session id and workspace metadata before reading content. If unavailable, pass a tight digest from this conversation. Never search unrelated conversations.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

Spawn three native read-only `code-reviewer` agents for the three lenses. Give them only this session transcript or the scoped digest and accessible connector references. A read-only brief does not assert connector availability.

Resolve each named role through the Codex runtime adapter and its optional `models.json`. Missing settings inherit the available native role/model. Do not guess model identifiers or retry unavailable model families.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `inherit-parent` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the native agent result.

## 3. Synthesize

Spawn one native `critic` or `default` synthesizer using the configured synthesis role. It spot-checks citations using exposed tools, then reads `references/synthesizer.md` with the three reports. Return Accepted / Rejected / Backlog. Report inaccessible sources.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Keep Backlog in the local report. File tracker items only when that external write is authorized.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the installed Codex `skill-creator` skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
